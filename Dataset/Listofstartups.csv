In the organised income sector there are different ways of recognising Financial Identity of a person through his salaried employment, ITR and other financial instruments to validate his creditworthiness. But this is not true for the unorganized income sector, say for a maid, electrician, Plumber etc. where they do not have an instrument to show their financial identity and thus the creditworthiness. Because of this they are deprived of many of the schemes of financial assistance from government. 

The problem will be resolved through a Deeptech platform (AI) and through an organised field force collating and verifying field data. The details of the beneficiary is taken in different headings like, the personal information, Acquaintances, Bank details, Loan details , Income , Skill set, Proof of assets, Family details , Expenditure details , Health information , and social contacts

Krishna Path Incubation Society- TBI KIET,Quest educational technologies LLP,Ghaziabad & Uttar Pradesh,Edutech,"Introduction of Hologram cards and Smartbook is the pioneering effort in India by Quest in transforming the conventional style of learning especially in schools. The very need for such methods of learning emerges from the sole textbook explanations without providing any graphical/animated representations. This piece of work started with just a small idea, but because of the involvement of many people’s effort in developing, it took the shape of a book. This book fundamentally uses the technology called Augmented Reality, where virtual objects are get placed or projected virtually into the real world using a digital device like a phone, tablet or any other compatible devices. A better understanding can be provided using such virtual projections without any practical/real implications on the subject areas. The technology has been in use in many sectors, predominantly designs, where the use of such means makes the process very efficient. Similarly, it could be used in educational sector where learning can become more fun and practical Every sector in India has seen great innovations in last few decades where technologies have played a vital role in upgrading the services and respective processes. However, the educational institutions and schools in India are yet to incorporate these technological advances which have potential use in this sector. Few new innovative techniques of learning were introduced in the sector like SmartBoards, which are still confined to a handful of schools (of any order) throughout the nation. Thus, it was one of our objectives to make it available to as many students as possible irrespective of their school, economic status, and location. It is user-friendly for an elementary student requiring the basic knowledge for operating any compatible electronic device, and possibilities for development and innovations with this tool by students itself is boundless. A three-dimensional representation of various elements in addition to two-dimensional representation and text explanation will allow students to understand without doubts. Such an application of the technology would increase the imagination power of students or anyone using the tool. The tool allows for a number of users at the same time, contrary to Smart-Boards where a tutor has control over visualization. We are making huge effort to make the education much more entertaining, elaborative, interesting and easy to comprehend. In the coming days, there are more Books coming on the way, based on a different subject like Historical buildings, Biology, Medical procedures etc. We believe you will love our effort and work we have put in and We will appreciate your support.

The platform analyzes cough signals along with a subset of symptoms from SGRQ (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and provides an assessment. Using proprietary machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms the platforms identifies underlying respiratory condition (yes/no), the pattern (obstructive, restricrive, mixed or normal) and its severity. It is a highly effective platform that achieves this functionality without the constraints of cost, location, scheduling, special equipment, and trained personnel.

The core technology has been enhanced to provide risk assessment for COVID-19 based on symptoms and cough analysis. Providing a longitudinal view on cough characteristics, the solution provides a platform to surveil susceptible populations by public health officials. Currently Apollo has integrated Swaasa Cough analysis with thier COVID19 risk assessment which is available to public for conducting risk assessment free of cost using Apollo 24x7 application."

Whenever a person purchases a product, the product will be registered on his/her mobile number. So all the products in his/her home will be listed in the application. 

When the customer logs in: 
- He/She can track their products warranty period 
- Can access digital invoices of products 
- View FAQ, OEM Terms for warranty 
- Get Contact, Location details of OEM 
- Push Notifications will be delivered to customers as the warranty period of a product is about to expire. 

And If any product malfunctions, by the click of a button, We will forward the warranty request directly to the OEM if under warranty or forward the insurance request to the Insurer if it’s an insurance case.
Without WarrantyMe, the customer has to find the invoice, look for the service centre, visit the location, wait for the slot and has to get the service done, and for insurance it’s the same.
